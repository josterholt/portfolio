# Portfolio App

This a portfolio [React](https://reactjs.org/) app written with
[Overmind](https://overmindjs.org/) for state management and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Data Source

This app uses static JSON data that is imported during build to keep things
simple.

### Custom Webpack Build

This is using a custom [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) build for dev and
prod. I like to keep an understanding of the JavaScript toolchain.

The toolchain includes:

-   [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
-   [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
-   [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
-   [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)
-   [Lintstaged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#readme)
-   [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
