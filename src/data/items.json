        "technicalDescription": "This was a pretty typical ecommerce solution allowing web users to securely order tickets and workshops online with varying quantities and pricing based on the date and quantity. Peak traffic was not pressing so a basic mySQL setup with Python/Django was sufficient.\n There were some challenging areas, such as syncing orders with the internal CRM. The primary issue was safely associating orders to existing accounts and contacts without compromising data integrity or generating duplicate account and contact records. Special checks on user generated data were put in place to achieve this, and tools were added to the CRM to merge any duplicates that were unable to be verified when the order was placed.",
